# Image Classification with CNNs and Transfer Learning

This project explores two approaches to image classification:
1. A custom-built Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
2. Transfer learning using pre-trained models (ResNet and MobileNet)

## Contents

- `simpleCNN.ipynb`: Implementation of a CNN from scratch.
- `TransferLearning.ipynb`: Fine-tuning of pre-trained networks for classification.

## Datasets Used

- Dataset: Kaggle Garbage Classification
- [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/asdasdasasdas/garbage-classification?resource=download ]

## Results

- Accuracy of custom CNN: 61.81%
- Accuracy of transfer learning model: 82.68%
